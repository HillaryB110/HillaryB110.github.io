<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hillary Brito</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am currently a Fellow in Pursuit's 9.5 cohort, learning to become a Full Stack Web Developer. Software Engineering was an unexpected path opened up to me through Pursuit, as before Pursuit, I was working in the Education field and loved learning and engaging with individuals on various topics. My strengths within the program are pulled in from my experiences in Historical Research, public speaking, and presenting research findings across age groups in both English and Spanish, as articulating what needs might exist, anticipating problems, and collaboratively solving them is essential in the tech world. I value community above all else, and Pursuit curates that robustly. I have an intense interest in Web development's design aspect, which leans heavily into my interests in fashion, style, and design. My journey into software engineering began when my partner recommended I applied to the program when I was between decisions about my career and furthering my education. My skills include Time Management and project planning, HTML and CSS, Javascript, research, and critical analysis skills. Diving into differing topics is fascinating because of my passion for education and learning. So being able to encounter new and unique problems every day keeps me engaged and endlessly fun. I am working to understand how scaffolding techniques in early childhood education mirror AI and Machine Learning.</h3>
